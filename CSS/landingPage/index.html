        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
        people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
        pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
        became nothing.

      <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
        and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
        turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
        oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
        lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

      Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?
      Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
      shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy
      store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

      Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in
      American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
      popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
      transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
      me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
